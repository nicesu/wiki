## Loading and Execution [Back](./../high_performance.md)

In fact, most browsers use a single process for both user interface (UI) updates and JavaScript execution, so only one can happen at any given moment in time. If we loaded JavaScript between a document, no matter using closed tag or `src` attribute, the browser has to block the user interaction to load and execute the script.

### Script Positioning

Traditionally, `<script>` tags that are used to load external JavaScript files have appeared in the `<head>`, along with `<link>` tags to load external CSS files and other metainformation(元信息s) about the page.

The theory was that it's best to **keep as many style and behavior dependencies together**, loading them first so that the page will come in looking and behaving correctly.

```html
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Script Example</title>
        
        <!-- Example of inefficient script positioning -->
        <script type="text/javascript" src="file1.js"></script>
        <script type="text/javascript" src="file2.js"></script>
        <script type="text/javascript" src="file3.js"></script>
        <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css"></link>
    </head>
</html>
```

Because scripts block downloading of all resource types on the page, it's recommended **to place all `<script>` tags as close to the bottom of the `<body>` tag as possible** so as not to affect the download of the entire page.

```html
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Script Example</title>
        <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css"></link>
    </head>
    <body>
        <p>Hello World!</p>
        
        <!-- Example of recommended script positioning -->
        <script type="text/javascript" src="file1.js"></script>
        <script type="text/javascript" src="file2.js"></script>
        <script type="text/javascript" src="file3.js"></script>
    </body>
</html>
```
